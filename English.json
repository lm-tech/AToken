    3. All users involved in mining during valid time will equally share the entire mining bonus according to the amount of vouchers.
    4. All pools reset at 00:00 of every natural day (GMT+8). The valid mining time of a pool is 24 hours.
    5. Users can receive the full shares of profit as long as he starts mining during the valid time.
    6. When the mining process is completed, the actual profit will be calculated in real time and automatically distributed to the user’s account. Meanwhile, the next round of pool will automatically become available for mining.
